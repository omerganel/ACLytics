# ACLytics
The intersection of biomechanics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics is transforming how we prevent ACL and lower-body injuries. Rather than relying on expensive lab tools or wearable sensors, athletes can now receive accurate feedback through imaging-based motion analysis powered by AI and physics. 
In order for the code to run, you, as the user, will need to retrieve an API key from OpenAI and put it in a .env file.
